# Welcome!

This page serves to remind you of the feedback submission details that we sent to you in an email.

## Submitting Feedback

On the right hand side of your FlexiSPY Desktop portal is a feedback tab that you 
should click anytime you notice a bug or have a suggestion.

After you submit feedback, a ticket gets created in this GitHub Repo. If you'd like to know what's happening as a result of your feedback, 
you'll want to join our GitHub team - which we've already sent you an invite for.

You can also submit issues directly from our GitHub repo - but we don't think it's as fun as using the feedback tool.

## Submission Suggestions

From the time you download FlexiSPY for Desktop, to the time you install and start using it, you should document any obstacles or annoyances you face.

For example, you could submit feedback if you notice any of these issues:

* A feature not working
* The dashboard looking broken on your screen
* Hiccups in the installation process

These are just a few things we'd like to know about. But as a rule of thumb, if thereâ€™s anything that you notice and think we should know, we want to know.
